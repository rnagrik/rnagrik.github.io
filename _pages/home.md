I'm a master's student at UC San Diego working in robotics. Before this, I graduated from IIT Delhi with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering.

My interests span motion and behaviour planning, SLAM, robot learning, and multi-agents systems with intelligent and safe coordination in complex real-world environments. I also work as a graduate researcher at the <a href = 'https://erl.ucsd.edu/'>Existential Robotics Laboratory (ERL)</a>.

During my undergraduate studies, I was part of the Formula SAE team, where I worked on developing the high-voltage battery for our open-wheel racecar.

In my spare time, I like to swim, hike along the San Diego coast line, watch football and solve sudoku.

Please feel free to check out my projects and reach out, if anything interests you. I'm always eager to connect!
