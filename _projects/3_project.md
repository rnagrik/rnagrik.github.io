In this project, we implement **Visualâ€“Inertial SLAM** using an IMU and a stereo camera. The goal is to estimate the robot trajectory and build a landmark map from synchronized visual measurements. 

We start by estimating the trajectory using IMU-only odometry, integrating on **SE(3)** exponential maps to obtain a smooth baseline trajectory. 

Next, we triangulate **landmarks** from stereo correspondences using disparity and camera intrinsics, and transform them to the world frame using the IMU trajectory estimate. Using this landmark mapping as a **prior**, we implement an **EKF**-based landmark update, assuming static landmarks, updating their locations across frames, producing a refined map. 


Finally, we implement an EKF-based **VI-SLAM** that fuses the motion model and the stereo projection model to jointly update the robot pose and landmark positions. We compare the IMU odometry to the fused VI-SLAM estimates and landmark maps.
